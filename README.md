## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor

### What I learned

I wanted to learn how to create clean and maintainable folder structure in this project using *React* and *SCSS* while learning each of its features. Each section of the page were splitted into its own *React* component, which were then styled with *SCSS* based on the corresponding folder name. 

I also learned to keep track of my progress using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) where I check for unfinished features or bugs.
